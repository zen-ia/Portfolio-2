            <h2>My Journey into Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Zenia | <strong>Date:</strong> September 23, 2024</p>
            <p>When I first started my journey into cybersecurity, I was a curious software engineering student with a passion for protecting systems and exploring vulnerabilities. I always believed technology is only as powerful as its security measures.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Cybersecurity?</h3>
            <p>Cybersecurity fascinated me because it combines problem-solving, coding, and continuous learning. I started small by understanding network protocols and tools like OWASP Amass and Wireshark. These tools allowed me to explore how networks operate and where vulnerabilities can occur.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>Through practice, I have developed skills in areas like DNS enumeration, creating VPNs, and ethical hacking exercises. Recently, I set up my own VPN server using Kali Linux as the backend and Windows as the client. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience.</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>As I move forward, I aim to contribute to secure system development. My focus will remain on building systems that are not only functional but resilient against attacks.</p>
            <p>To all aspiring cybersecurity enthusiasts: Keep learning, stay curious, and embrace challenges. The field is vast, and every day brings something new to discover!</p>
